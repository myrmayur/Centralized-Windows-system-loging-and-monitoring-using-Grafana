# Setting up Winlogbeat to Collect Windows Logs and Visualize Them in Grafana

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Winlogbeat on Windows to collect Windows logs and then visualizing them in Grafana via Elasticsearch.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Windows machine(s) from which you want to collect logs
- Ubuntu machine with Elasticsearch and Grafana installed

## Step 1: Install and Configure Winlogbeat on Windows

1. Download Winlogbeat from the official Elastic website: [Winlogbeat Downloads](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/winlogbeat).
2. Follow the installation instructions provided for your Windows version.
3. Configure Winlogbeat to point to your Elasticsearch instance in `winlogbeat.yml` configuration file.
   ```yaml
   output.elasticsearch:
     hosts: ["<your-elasticsearch-host>:9200"]
   ```

## Step 2: Install and Configure Elasticsearch on Ubuntu

1. Install Elasticsearch by following the instructions in the official Elasticsearch documentation: [Install Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/deb.html).
2. Make sure Elasticsearch is running and accessible from your Windows machine.

## Step 3: Install and Configure Grafana on Ubuntu

1. Install Grafana by following the instructions in the official Grafana documentation: [Install Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/debian/).
2. Access Grafana's web interface and set it up according to your preferences.

## Step 4: Configure Grafana Dashboard for Windows Logs

1. In Grafana, navigate to the Dashboards section.
2. Import a pre-made dashboard for Windows logs or create a new one based on your requirements.
3. Configure the data source to point to your Elasticsearch instance.

## Step 5: View Windows Logs in Grafana

1. Ensure Winlogbeat is running on your Windows machine(s).
2. Navigate to the Grafana dashboard you configured to view the collected Windows logs.

## Step 6: Deploy Winlogbeat Installation Script Across Windows Machines

To ensure Winlogbeat is installed on all centralized Windows machines in your company, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Installation Script**:
   - Open a text editor and copy your shell script into a new file, e.g., `install_winlogbeat.sh`.
   - Make sure the script is configured to install Winlogbeat silently without user intervention.

2. **Store the Script on a Network Share**:
   - Place the `install_winlogbeat.sh` script on a network share that is accessible by all Windows machines.

3. **Set Up Group Policy Object (GPO)**:
   - Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) on a domain controller.
   - Create a new Group Policy Object (GPO) or use an existing one to apply the script to desired Windows machines.
   
4. **Edit the GPO**:
   - Navigate to `Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> Scripts (Startup/Shutdown)`.
   - Add the `install_winlogbeat.sh` script to the startup scripts folder and link it to the appropriate domain or organizational unit (OU).
   
5. **Deploy the Script**:
   - Restart the Windows machines or wait for the Group Policy to refresh to initiate the installation of Winlogbeat.
   
6. **Verify Installation**:
   - Check if Winlogbeat is installed correctly on the Windows machines by verifying its presence in the Programs and Features list or through other means.

By following these steps, you can automate the deployment of Winlogbeat across all centralized Windows machines in your company, ensuring consistent monitoring and logging.
